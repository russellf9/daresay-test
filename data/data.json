         "name":"Vito Corleone",
         "bio":"Vito was born in the small town of Corleone, Sicily, on December 7, 1891. Antonio Andolini, his father, is murdered by the local Mafia boss, Don Ciccio, because he refused to pay tribute to him. His older brother, Paolo, swears revenge, but he too is murdered soon afterwards. Eventually, Ciccios henchmen come to the Andolinis home to kill Vito. In desperation, Vitos mother takes her son to see the Mafia chieftain herself and begs him to spare Vito. Ciccio refuses, reasoning that Vito will also seek revenge as an adult. Upon Ciccios refusal, Vitos mother puts a knife to his throat, allowing her son to escape while she is killed. Later that night, he is smuggled away, fleeing from Sicily to seek refuge in America on a cargo ship full of immigrants. In the film, he is renamed Vito Corleone because the immigration workers at Ellis Island mistake Andolini for his middle name and the name of his town for his last name. According to The Godfather Part II, he later adopts the middle name Andolini to acknowledge his heritage.",

She married Vito Corleone in 1914, and two years later, they had their first child, Santino. Carmela suffered several miscarriages in the following years, before giving birth to the sickly Frederico. At this time, Vito Corleone was struggling to make ends meet, as Massimo Fanucci had forced him out of his job at Abbandando Grosseria.",

They get married in 1945; both the book and film open with their wedding. Vito doesnt like the idea of Connie marrying a small-time criminal, and is also displeased by the fact Rizzi isn't a full-blooded Sicilian; his mother was from northern Italy, hence Rizzi's blue eyes and blond hair. He only grants Connies hand in marriage on condition that they hold an old-style Sicilian wedding.",
